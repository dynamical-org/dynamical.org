      "content_html": "<p>Last week, we announced <a href=\"http://dynamical.org/\">dynamical.org</a> to the world. The response was unexpected*: in just seven days, over a hundred nerds registered themselves as testers with many more following along for the ride.</p>\n<p>Apparently, we are not alone in our frustration with yesterday's weather data. Together we can create a future of well-organized data about our most beloved chaotic system!</p>\n<p><strong>Today, we are excited to announce the first entry into dynamicalâ€™s catalog: <a href=\"https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gfs-analysis-hourly/\">an hourly GFS analysis</a> from 2015-01-15 to present.</strong></p>\n<p>Testers! Fire up your rigs - in the catalog entry above, we've included documentation and an example notebook. If you run into any issues, email us at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@dynamical.org\">feedback@dynamical.org</a>. As our very first release, weâ€™re expecting there will be lots of additions and refinement based on community input.</p>\n<p>Our pals at <a href=\"https://source.coop/\">Source Cooperative</a> are generously providing storage for this first catalog entry. Their team is wonderful and their mission is badass - check them and the broader <a href=\"https://radiant.earth/\">Radiant Earth</a> organization out.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvnbpG_NA2Y\">weather</a>^!</p>\n<p>MM</p>\n<p>* or expected, depending on how long you've been working with yesterday's weather data</p>\n<p>^ courtesy of Alex M.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Introducing dynamical!</p>\n<p>Thank you for being the first to follow our journey making weather and climate data more accessible. We are humbled by the response. Our mission clearly strikes a chord - weather data today is a pain to work with.</p>\n<p>Over <strong>one hundred people</strong> (!?) signed up to test the first versions of the data we endeavor to release. And thatâ€™s without having spilled the beans on the best parts ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>So whatâ€™s the plan? First, check out Aldenâ€™s fantastic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uR6-UVO_3k8?si=AgXz6DM6l0mYiENw\">introduction to dynamical.org</a> (video link). Second, <a href=\"https://dynamical.org/about.html\">read</a> about how we are designing dynamical to be a long-term steward and rock-solid foundation on which to build.</p>\n<p>We are aiming to release our first public test next week in collaboration with <a href=\"https://source.coop/\">Source Cooperative</a>: <strong>a GFS analysis with a long historical record</strong>. If you are interested in testing this out and havenâ€™t already told us, reply to this email. We plan to fast-follow with documentation and a data catalog with our roadmap.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the <a href=\"https://ought.bandcamp.com/track/beautiful-blue-sky\">weather</a>!</p>\n<p>MM + AKS</p>\n<p>P.S. Please forward this email to folks working with weather data and consider amplifying our announcement on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marshallmoutenot_introducing-dynamicalorg-fast-optimized-activity-7211005158162317313-rk-V\">linkedin</a> / <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dynamical\">fedi</a>!</p>\n",
