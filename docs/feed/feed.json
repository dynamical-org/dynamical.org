			"content_html": "<p>Introducing dynamical!</p>\n<p>Thank you for being the first to follow our journey making weather and climate data more accessible. We are humbled by the response. Our mission clearly strikes a chord - weather data today is a pain to work with.</p>\n<p>Over <strong>one hundred people</strong> (!?) signed up to test the first versions of the data we endeavor to release. And thatâ€™s without having spilled the beans on the best parts ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>So whatâ€™s the plan? First, check out Aldenâ€™s fantastic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uR6-UVO_3k8?si=AgXz6DM6l0mYiENw\">introduction to dynamical.org</a> (video link). Second, <a href=\"https://dynamical.org/about.html\">read</a> about how we are designing dynamical to be a long-term steward and rock-solid foundation on which to build.</p>\n<p>We are aiming to release our first public test next week in collaboration with <a href=\"https://source.coop/\">Source Cooperative</a>: <strong>a GFS analysis with a long historical record</strong>. If you are interested in testing this out and havenâ€™t already told us, reply to this email. We plan to fast-follow with documentation and a data catalog with our roadmap.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the <a href=\"https://ought.bandcamp.com/track/beautiful-blue-sky\">weather</a>!</p>\n<p>MM + AKS</p>\n<p>P.S. Please forward this email to folks working with weather data and consider amplifying our announcement on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marshallmoutenot_introducing-dynamicalorg-fast-optimized-activity-7211005158162317313-rk-V\">linkedin</a> / <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dynamical\">fedi</a>!</p>\n",
