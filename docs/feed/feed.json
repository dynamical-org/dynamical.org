We‚Äôre already experimenting with it and considering support once the storage format stabilizes. <a href=\"https://icechunk.io/\">Check it out here</a></li>\n<li>China is planning to become a weather superpower by investing in advanced meteorological technologies and infrastructure to enhance its weather forecasting capabilities. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-11/china-is-planning-to-become-a-weather-superpower\">Bloomberg</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Finally - we'll be launching our steering committee this quarter.

Thanks to everyone who has tested it out.</li>\n<li>We are prepping to launch <strong>NOAA GEFS</strong> <strong>forecasts</strong> as the second entry to <a href=\"http://dynamical.org/catalog\">dynamical.org/catalog</a>. It will include a large historical forecast record and update in real-time. Dealing with GEFS in its standard format has, in the past, broken my spirit; and I suppose it‚Äôs part of why we are so passionate about making weather data easier to work with! So‚Ä¶ thank you GEFS?

Common themes included the value of live updating and forecast data, and a clear preference for reading data with python + xarray. That aligned with our expectations (wonderful) and is reflected in our roadmap above. We did see more desire for long history (re)analysis data than we had anticipated -- we'll be moving up a true reanalysis dataset in priority thanks to this feedback. Reply to this email if there's a specific reanalysis you'd like!</p>\n<h3>Assembling our Steering Committee</h3>\n<p>We are officially launching our steering committee, which will be comprised of industry users and experts in the technical and scientific domain. The committee will meet quarterly to evaluate and influence the catalog and open-source roadmap and advise potential collaborations and partnerships.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre interested in joining or nominating someone else, please respond to this email or email <a href=\"mailto:marshall@dynamical.org\">marshall@dynamical.org</a>!</p>\n<h3>What we‚Äôve been reading</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there‚Äôd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you‚Äôd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a <em>h-whack!</em>‚Äîbum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum‚Äîand the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit‚Äîand then <em>rip</em> comes another flash and another sockdolager.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I‚Äôm reading <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, which has some stellar meteorological descriptions. Should we petition NOAA to make their detailed forecasts use ‚Äúh-wack!-bum! bum!‚Äù and ‚Äúsockdolager?‚Äù I think yes.</p>\n<p>We enjoyed Dr. Jack Kelly‚Äôs post on the vision this community shares, where he outlined a complimentary route to solving major pain points.

      "content_html": "<p>Last week, we announced <a href=\"http://dynamical.org/\">dynamical.org</a> to the world. The response was unexpected*: in just seven days, over a hundred nerds registered themselves as testers with many more following along for the ride.</p>\n<p>Apparently, we are not alone in our frustration with yesterday's weather data. Together we can create a future of well-organized data about our most beloved chaotic system!</p>\n<p><strong>Today, we are excited to announce the first entry into dynamical‚Äôs catalog: <a href=\"https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gfs-analysis-hourly/\">an hourly GFS analysis</a> from 2015-01-15 to present.</strong></p>\n<p>Testers! Fire up your rigs - in the catalog entry above, we've included documentation and an example notebook. If you run into any issues, email us at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@dynamical.org\">feedback@dynamical.org</a>. As our very first release, we‚Äôre expecting there will be lots of additions and refinement based on community input.</p>\n<p>Our pals at <a href=\"https://source.coop/\">Source Cooperative</a> are generously providing storage for this first catalog entry. Their team is wonderful and their mission is badass - check them and the broader <a href=\"https://radiant.earth/\">Radiant Earth</a> organization out.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvnbpG_NA2Y\">weather</a>^!</p>\n<p>MM</p>\n<p>* or expected, depending on how long you've been working with yesterday's weather data</p>\n<p>^ courtesy of Alex M.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>Introducing dynamical!</p>\n<p>Thank you for being the first to follow our journey making weather and climate data more accessible. We are humbled by the response. Our mission clearly strikes a chord - weather data today is a pain to work with.</p>\n<p>Over <strong>one hundred people</strong> (!?) signed up to test the first versions of the data we endeavor to release. And that‚Äôs without having spilled the beans on the best parts üòâ</p>\n<p>So what‚Äôs the plan? First, check out Alden‚Äôs fantastic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uR6-UVO_3k8?si=AgXz6DM6l0mYiENw\">introduction to dynamical.org</a> (video link). Second, <a href=\"https://dynamical.org/about.html\">read</a> about how we are designing dynamical to be a long-term steward and rock-solid foundation on which to build.</p>\n<p>We are aiming to release our first public test next week in collaboration with <a href=\"https://source.coop/\">Source Cooperative</a>: <strong>a GFS analysis with a long historical record</strong>. If you are interested in testing this out and haven‚Äôt already told us, reply to this email. We plan to fast-follow with documentation and a data catalog with our roadmap.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the <a href=\"https://ought.bandcamp.com/track/beautiful-blue-sky\">weather</a>!</p>\n<p>MM + AKS</p>\n<p>P.S. Please forward this email to folks working with weather data and consider amplifying our announcement on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marshallmoutenot_introducing-dynamicalorg-fast-optimized-activity-7211005158162317313-rk-V\">linkedin</a> / <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@dynamical\">fedi</a>!</p>\n",
