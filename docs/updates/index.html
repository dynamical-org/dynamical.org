    <h2>GEFS analysis is live!</h2>
    <em>2025-04-29</em>
    <p>Well, technically it's been live for a few days. Check out our new <a href="https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gefs-analysis/">GEFS analysis</a>, which is derived from the <a href="https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gefs-forecast-35-day/">GEFS forecast</a> catalog item.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/3f8a5ed8-29ca-4b60-88d3-690add9bfa80.png?w=960&amp;fit=max" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>Both are live updating, and the analysis was designed to work easily with the forecast dataset. For example, you can develop your algorithm/model/sentient AI television weatherperson on the analysis, and then deploy it live with the forecast dataset. COOL!</p>
<ul>
<li>25+ years of data</li>
<li>Live updating</li>
<li>Performance optimized for time series queries</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Striving to create weather data experiences as satisfying as when you peel citrus in one contiguous piece. You know what I mean :)</em></p>

    <h2>1 Million Requests!</h2>
    <em>2025-03-20</em>
    <p>While modest on the scale of Computers, 1M is not bad for our baby’s first week in the world. The gigabytes are flying and we’ve received requests from 51 countries over the last few days. No single person has downloaded the whole dataset, so thank you but also WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!</p>
<p>A reminder that the <a href="https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gefs-forecast-35-day/">GEFS</a> dataset is Zarr v3, so don’t forget to update your Xarray&gt;=2025.1.2 which includes v3 support!</p>
<h2>Let’s make Phase 1 happen (and how you can help)</h2>
<p>With GEFS complete, we are already working on our next slate of catalog additions. Our Phase 1 will include the following datasets:</p>
<p>Forecasts</p>
<ul>
<li>NOAA GEFS, 35 day, 1x day <em>(we did it)</em></li>
<li>NOAA HRRR <em>(Tony is on it!)</em></li>
<li>NOAA GFS <em>(Dan is on it!)</em></li>
<li>NOAA GEFS, 10 day, 4x day</li>
<li>ECMWF AIFS</li>
<li>ECMWF ENS, 15 day, 1x day</li>
<li>ECCC HRDPS</li>
</ul>
<p>Analyses</p>
<ul>
<li>NOAA GEFS <em>(Alden is on it!)</em></li>
<li>ECMWF AIFS</li>
<li>ECMWF ENS</li>
<li>NOAA HRRR</li>
<li>NOAA GFS</li>
<li>ECCC HRDPS</li>
</ul>
<p>Three ways you, dear reader, can help:</p>
<p><strong>[1] Financial support</strong>:</p>
<p>We estimate that making<strong> Phase 1 operational &amp; publicly accessible</strong> will run around $100,000 per year with the cost growing by approximately 30% year over year as the datasets get inevitably larger. Pennies compared to the value, in my humble opinion!</p>
<p>So… we are seeking our first cohort of sponsors to make these forecasts and analyses a reality. If you belong to an organization that benefits from, and is able to support our work, <strong>we’d love to hear from you</strong>. Reply to this email to learn more about our plans for fiscal sponsorship.</p>
<p>[2] <strong>Publicize these datasets as they’re released!</strong> Tell your coworkers, post on whatever social media we are using these days, tell your parents over dinner, teach your toddler about scones and pancakes.</span></p>
<p>[3] <strong>Write code?</strong> Not quite yet but soon. We are testing to see if our open source code so far is sufficiently clear to have other folks pitch in and write reformatters for new datasets. If all goes well we may solicit help from your big brain.</p>
<p>Help us out, and especially [1] so that there are NO BLOCKERS, ONLY WEATHER.</p>

    <h2>About GEFS-fing Time &amp; Introducing Our Steering Committee</h2>
    <em>2025-03-12</em>
    <p>Weatherlings, the time has come for our first non-demo release. Weighing in at <strong>115TB</strong> compressed and <strong>815TB</strong> (!) uncompressed, GEFS ain’t messing around.</p>
<p>Last year, we launched <a href="https://dynamical.org">dynamical.org</a> into the world and watched as hundreds of weather data nerds emerged (sublimated?) from the woodwork. Our community has been growing steadily, united by a shared mission to make weather data <em>Spark Joy</em>.</p>
<h1>🌎 Introducing NOAA's Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) 35-Day Forecasts!</h1>

<h1>Catalog Updates: GEFS is Almost Here!</h1>
<p>We’ve made some big strides toward releasing a <em>complete</em> archive and live-updating GEFS dataset to the catalog:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/dynamical-org/reformatters">GEFS reformatter</a> can now create an archive of years of data <em>super quickly</em>, thanks to tons of parallelism.</li>
<li>The dataset is not only comprehensive but also a dream to work with:</li>

<p>Woah nelly, check out those attributes!</p>
<p>We’re testing out operational updates in our compute cluster <em>THIS WEEK</em>. Once that’s complete, we’ll be ready to push live, real-time updates to the catalog. So close, we can almost taste the churros/pancakes/scones (ha ha ha get it).</p>
<h1>What We Are Reading</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Zarr Python 3 released!</strong> We’re especially excited about the included chunk sharding extension, which will enable a much wider range of efficient read patterns with a single, optimized dataset. <a href="https://zarr.dev/blog/zarr-python-3-release">Read more here</a></li>
<li><strong>Earthmover debuted Icechunk</strong>, a new open storage engine for Zarr datasets. It supports simple and correct updates to datasets that are being read from and written to simultaneously (e.g., live-updated weather), along with great features like dataset versioning and improved read performance. We’re already experimenting with it and considering support once the storage format stabilizes. <a href="https://icechunk.io/">Check it out here</a></li>
<li>China is planning to become a weather superpower by investing in advanced meteorological technologies and infrastructure to enhance its weather forecasting capabilities. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-11/china-is-planning-to-become-a-weather-superpower">Bloomberg</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally - we'll be launching our steering committee this quarter. Thanks to all those who responded with interest in helping us achieve our mission.</p>

    <h2>September update</h2>
    <em>2024-09-26</em>
    <p>Ahoy weatherheads! It’s been a busy few months for us as we shift gears from dreaming to building.</p>
<h3>Catalog updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our dataset for <a href="https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gfs-analysis-hourly/">NOAA GFS analysis</a> has getting some awesome usage! Thanks to everyone who has tested it out.</li>
<li>We are prepping to launch <strong>NOAA GEFS</strong> <strong>forecasts</strong> as the second entry to <a href="http://dynamical.org/catalog">dynamical.org/catalog</a>. It will include a large historical forecast record and update in real-time. Dealing with GEFS in its standard format has, in the past, broken my spirit; and I suppose it’s part of why we are so passionate about making weather data easier to work with! So… thank you GEFS? Excited for this one.
<img src="/assets/gefs-dlwrf-img-only.png" alt="GEFS ensemble average downward long-wave radiation flux.">
<em>GEFS ensemble average downward long-wave radiation flux.</em></li>
<li>We plan to fast-follow GEFS with <strong>GFS</strong> (forecasts vs our current analysis) and <strong>HRRR</strong> from NOAA as well as <strong>GDPS</strong> and <strong>HRDPS</strong> from ECCC (Environment and Climate Change Canada). As part of these releases we will be announcing our first <strong>catalog sponsor</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<h3>GFS analysis feedback</h3>
<p>A hearty thank you to everyone who filled out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqDiWRfTQfZgejPWWfNoBwcm4m2wxa9qxgSZIunsnbhH15XQ/viewform">GFS survey</a>. Common themes included the value of live updating and forecast data, and a clear preference for reading data with python + xarray. That aligned with our expectations (wonderful) and is reflected in our roadmap above. We did see more desire for long history (re)analysis data than we had anticipated -- we'll be moving up a true reanalysis dataset in priority thanks to this feedback. Reply to this email if there's a specific reanalysis you'd like!</p>
<h3>Assembling our Steering Committee</h3>
<p>We are officially launching our steering committee, which will be comprised of industry users and experts in the technical and scientific domain. The committee will meet quarterly to evaluate and influence the catalog and open-source roadmap and advise potential collaborations and partnerships.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in joining or nominating someone else, please respond to this email or email <a href="mailto:marshall@dynamical.org">marshall@dynamical.org</a>!</p>
<h3>What we’ve been reading</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there’d come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you’d see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a <em>h-whack!</em>—bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit—and then <em>rip</em> comes another flash and another sockdolager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m reading <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, which has some stellar meteorological descriptions. Should we petition NOAA to make their detailed forecasts use “h-wack!-bum! bum!” and “sockdolager?” I think yes.</p>
<p>We enjoyed Dr. Jack Kelly’s post on the vision this community shares, where he outlined a complimentary route to solving major pain points. Thanks for the <a href="http://dynamical.org">dynamical.org</a> shoutouts, Jack! Definitely check it out here: <a href="https://openclimatefix.org/post/lazy-loading-making-it-easier-to-access-vast-datasets-of-weather-satellite-data">https://openclimatefix.org/post/lazy-loading-making-it-easier-to-access-vast-datasets-of-weather-satellite-data</a></p>
<p>We were thrilled to see our pals at <strong>Brightband</strong> <a href="https://www.brightband.com/blog/introducing-brightband">announce themselves to the world</a>. The field of AI meteorological forecasts is progressing at quite the clip - three cheers for more open source models! We also enjoyed <strong>Zeus AI</strong>'s cool work <a href="https://myzeus.ai/earthnet-a-multi-modal-foundation-model-for-global-data-assimilation-of-earth-observations/">synthesizing multiple, sparse data sources into a single gap filled analysis state</a>.</p>

    <h2>Let there be zarr: GFS hourly analysis is live</h2>
    <em>2024-07-09</em>
    <p>Last week, we announced <a href="http://dynamical.org/">dynamical.org</a> to the world. The response was unexpected*: in just seven days, over a hundred nerds registered themselves as testers with many more following along for the ride.</p>
<p>Apparently, we are not alone in our frustration with yesterday's weather data. Together we can create a future of well-organized data about our most beloved chaotic system!</p>
<p><strong>Today, we are excited to announce the first entry into dynamical’s catalog: <a href="https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gfs-analysis-hourly/">an hourly GFS analysis</a> from 2015-01-15 to present.</strong></p>
<p>Testers! Fire up your rigs - in the catalog entry above, we've included documentation and an example notebook. If you run into any issues, email us at <a href="mailto:feedback@dynamical.org">feedback@dynamical.org</a>. As our very first release, we’re expecting there will be lots of additions and refinement based on community input.</p>
<p>Our pals at <a href="https://source.coop/">Source Cooperative</a> are generously providing storage for this first catalog entry. Their team is wonderful and their mission is badass - check them and the broader <a href="https://radiant.earth/">Radiant Earth</a> organization out.</p>
<p>Enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvnbpG_NA2Y">weather</a>^!</p>

    <p>Introducing dynamical!</p>
<p>Thank you for being the first to follow our journey making weather and climate data more accessible. We are humbled by the response. Our mission clearly strikes a chord - weather data today is a pain to work with.</p>
<p>Over <strong>one hundred people</strong> (!?) signed up to test the first versions of the data we endeavor to release. And that’s without having spilled the beans on the best parts 😉</p>
<p>So what’s the plan? First, check out Alden’s fantastic <a href="https://youtu.be/uR6-UVO_3k8?si=AgXz6DM6l0mYiENw">introduction to dynamical.org</a> (video link). Second, <a href="https://dynamical.org/about.html">read</a> about how we are designing dynamical to be a long-term steward and rock-solid foundation on which to build.</p>
<p>We are aiming to release our first public test next week in collaboration with <a href="https://source.coop/">Source Cooperative</a>: <strong>a GFS analysis with a long historical record</strong>. If you are interested in testing this out and haven’t already told us, reply to this email. We plan to fast-follow with documentation and a data catalog with our roadmap.</p>
<p>Enjoy the <a href="https://ought.bandcamp.com/track/beautiful-blue-sky">weather</a>!</p>
<p>MM + AKS</p>
<p>P.S. Please forward this email to folks working with weather data and consider amplifying our announcement on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marshallmoutenot_introducing-dynamicalorg-fast-optimized-activity-7211005158162317313-rk-V">linkedin</a> / <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dynamical">fedi</a>!</p>
