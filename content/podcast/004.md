While staring into uncertainty might sound abyssal and frightening, ensemble models have proven (to us, at least) that this isn’t the case. In today’s episode, we’re exploring two papers with different approaches to ensemble forecasting. This "choir" approach to weather prediction is one that embraces chaos rather than striving to chart a single line of truth on a graph by generating dozens or even hundreds of slightly different predictions that together map a full range of possible outcomes.

We’re unpacking FGN, the latest variant of AIFS, and their differing approaches to the same challenge: **how can we create a confident forecast of an assuredly uncertain future.**
