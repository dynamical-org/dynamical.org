Where does the end begin? Where does the end end? And what the HELL is happening in the middle?

These are some of the questions we tackle in this episode as we explore Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end forecasting system. End-to-end models are super cool, and likely to be the future of weather forecasting—but they also revitalize old questions about transparency, end-user trust, and the fidelity & availability of raw observations.

Join us as we unpack what an end-to-end model is, the Aardvark Weather approach, and how these models at-large might shape the landscape of forecasting (And books. Always books.)
