In this episode, we're covering two papers on zero-shot forecasting: NXAI's TiRex and Amazon's Chronos-2. You may be asking… Is it pronounced tee·rɛks? Is it tye·rɛks? Is it a titan? God of time? Is a time series just a sequence? Is a sequence just a sentence? Is time a sentence? Is time a poem? As a poem constellates images, and an LLM strings together tokens, the authors apply this approach to time series forecasting, offering new opportunities for zero-shot weather prediction.

We discuss the history of the term "Zero-shot," breakdown each paper from training data to industry applications, and wax poetic about the paradigm shift these models are bringing to earth systems forecasting.
