Bias has a pretty well-known definition in the world of AI/ML programming. But today’s paper asks us to expand that definition and consider how cultural, organizational, and human forces can intersect with development. The authors of “Identifying and Categorizing Bias in AI/ML for Earth Sciences” argue that, beyond considering bias and before mitigating bias, developers ought to be able to identify bias in all its modes & forms. Their taxonomy of bias is helpful, and inspired us to create an actionable check list of our own.

**A check list for mitigating bias (in developing AI or for really any kind of technological development)**

- Use the language of “bias”, acknowledging both social and technical bias
- Define your specific user and use case early
- Establish a clear baseline for comparison
- Ensure diversity of perspectives on your team
- Practice reflexivity (question your assumptions, and continue that line of questioning throughout the development process.)
- Examine your incentives vs. end-user incentives
- Prioritize transparency (in your decision-making and in your incentives & goals.)
