Machine learning dominates the conversation, but what will happen to the centuries-old physical equations that built our understanding of the atmosphere? How are the two approaches at odds? How might they coexist?

Today’s paper, *NeuralGCM*, sheds light on how physics-based and AI approaches might be a powerful pairing for weather forecasting. For the first truly hybrid model we’ve discussed, it’s only fitting that we’ve also taken a hybrid approach in this conversation. So join us for hybrid models, data compression, *Dragon Ball Z*, and the strange future of primitive equations.
