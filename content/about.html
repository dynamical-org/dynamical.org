  <p>
    We are certainly not the first to make public zarrs of weather data. What’s
    new is a long-term commitment to maintaining the open-source code and open
    data repositories we produce and an organization purpose-built to do just
    that.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>dynamical.org</strong>'s mission is to
    <mark>
      advance humanity's ability to access, understand, and act on accurate
      weather and climate data.
    </mark>
  </p>
  <p>
    The organization is designed for long-term operations and stewardship using
    what we call "Public Benefit Corporation, Hardcore Mode." In this model we
    explicitly:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>prohibit sale of the organization;</li>
    <li>
      require (hypothetical) profit be reinvested in the organization's purpose;
      and
    </li>
    <li>set organizational priorities led by active members and users.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Why? We want the data and code produced to be stewarded by an organization
    that will be
    <strong>here for the long-term</strong>. None of us want to build on a
    foundation that shifts or crumbles in a few years. The result is a
    stewardship organization designed to operate independently and perpetually.
