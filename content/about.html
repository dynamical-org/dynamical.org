    We are certainly not the first to make public zarrs of weather data. Whatâ€™s new is a long-term
    commitment to maintaining the open-source code and open data repositories we produce and an
    organization purpose-built to do just that.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>dynamical.org</strong>'s mission is to
    <mark>
      advance humanity's ability to access, understand, and act on accurate weather and climate
      data.
    </mark>
  </p>
  <p>
    The organization is designed for long-term operations and stewardship using what we call "Public
    Benefit Corporation, Hardcore Mode." In this model we explicitly:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>prohibit sale of the organization;</li>
    <li>require (hypothetical) profit be reinvested in the organization's purpose; and</li>
    <li>set organizational priorities led by active members and users.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Why? We want the data and code produced to be stewarded by an organization that will be
    <strong>here for the long-term</strong>. None of us want to build on a foundation that shifts or
    crumbles in a few years. The result is a stewardship organization designed to operate
    independently and perpetually.
