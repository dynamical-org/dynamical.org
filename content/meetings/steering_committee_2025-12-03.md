## Community engagement 

Steering committee members discussed expanding our outreach to help new weather data user communities become aware of our work. We’ve begun this outreach work based on Steering committee suggestions and conferences such as AGU and AMS have been helpful as well, albeit US focused. If you know a community who you think might find our data useful, please email us to let us know! We’d love to work with you to make examples relevant to new users.

## Usage statistics 

November (the last complete month) was our highest request month yet at 80M at ~50TB served. We continue to see a skewed distribution in requested variables, with temperature, precipitation and wind leading across datasets. Usage has become more global, while still led by access from the US and Europe.
