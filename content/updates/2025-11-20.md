Colder temps may be here (where I live, at least), but ensembles are _so hot right now_. Can we agree on that? No? Ha ha get it!?

As of this week The European Centre's IFS ENS forecast is live and updating in [our catalog](https://dynamical.org/catalog/ecmwf-ifs-ens-forecast-15-day-0-25-degree/). See the catalog for init times, spatiotemporal domain, and the variable list.

I suppose with that HRRR ["release trailer"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marshallmoutenot_hrrr-is-live-the-forecast-archive-from-activity-7378448846290575360-dRMZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAOgBWEBfMMmd2xB6DueOM-OrcPrj2eIBlM) I've signed myself up for something completely unsustainable -- but until that time comes, when the catalog entries cometh faster than I can splice together sci fi video clips... -- ENS has a release trailer [too](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marshallmoutenot_ecmwf-ifs-ens-forecast-is-live-on-dynamicalorg-activity-7396224185951211520-3vy_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAOgBWEBfMMmd2xB6DueOM-OrcPrj2eIBlM).

# Icechunk

Icechunk versions are available to select groups for testing (and will likely be our default in the future). If you want to try them out please respond.

I've actually been a little surprised at the lack of Icechunk inquiries. Are y'all even drinking the cutting edge data format koolaide?!
