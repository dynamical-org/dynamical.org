title: "introducing a new pod; GFS forecasts incoming"

Not even my proprietary UniverseCast™ Reality Ensemble Forecast⁺ could have predicted this. The most unlikely of scenarios: A **podcast**? Yes, a podcast. And it's called [**Weathering**](https://dynamical.org/podcast).

We are trying to make sense of the current wave of _progress_ occurring in weather forecasting.

Each episode, we focus on a paper or group of papers and try to take a intertextual approach -- clicking on mental hyperlinks to help us understand and put into context. The format is inspired by the only two podcasts I regularly listen to ([Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.org/) and Jed Sundwall's [Techs on Texts](https://techsontexts.net/)).

[**Episode 001: The limits of predictability**](https://dynamical.org/podcast/001/)  
Our maiden voyage dives into a fresh-off-the-press paper from the University of Washington: _Testing the Limit of Atmospheric Predictability With a Machine Learning Weather Model._

Check it out, and let us know if there's a paper you think we should cover next.

In normal dynamical.org news, operational GFS forecasts are landing in the catalog imminently. We previously did an analysis as our first demo, so this will be a nice upgrade to tie the bow on the GEFS/GFS family.

After that, the catalog will be expanding rapidly! Stay tuned.
