title: "Let there be zarr: GFS hourly analysis is live"

Last week, we announced [dynamical.org](http://dynamical.org/) to the world. The response was unexpected\*: in just seven days, over a hundred nerds registered themselves as testers with many more following along for the ride.

Apparently, we are not alone in our frustration with yesterday's weather data. Together we can create a future of well-organized data about our most beloved chaotic system!

**Today, we are excited to announce the first entry into dynamical’s catalog: [an hourly GFS analysis](https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gfs-analysis-hourly/) from 2015-01-15 to present.**

Testers! Fire up your rigs - in the catalog entry above, we've included documentation and an example notebook. If you run into any issues, email us at [feedback@dynamical.org](mailto:feedback@dynamical.org). As our very first release, we’re expecting there will be lots of additions and refinement based on community input.

Our pals at [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/) are generously providing storage for this first catalog entry. Their team is wonderful and their mission is badass - check them and the broader [Radiant Earth](https://radiant.earth/) organization out.

Enjoy the [weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvnbpG_NA2Y)^!

\* or expected, depending on how long you've been working with yesterday's weather data
