Well, technically it's been live for a few days. Check out our new [GEFS analysis](https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gfs-analysis-hourly/), which is derived from the [GEFS forecast](https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gefs-forecast-35-day/) catalog item.

Both are live updating, and the analysis was designed to work easily with the forecast dataset. For example, you can develop your algorithm/model/sentient AI television weatherperson on the analysis, and then deploy it live with the forecast dataset. COOL!

- 25+ years of data
- Live updating
- Performance optimized for time series queries

_Striving to create weather data experiences as satisfying as when you peel citrus in one contiguous piece. You know what I mean :)_
