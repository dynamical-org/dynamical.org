The last time I wrote you all, the summer sweltered, determinism was still alive (now [it is dead](https://dynamical.org/podcast/), and only 11 AI weather papers had been published in Nature (now the total is up to 188,732).

If I keep it up y'all are never going to take me seriously. But lo, some seriously new stuff!

# HRRR go brrr

![HRRR wind speed @ 10m, 2025-05-25](https://media.dynamical.org/hrrr_wind_speed_10m_2025-05-25T00_conus.webp)

HRRR forecasts are live and updating! Check out the release trailer (lol) [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marshallmoutenot_hrrr-is-live-the-forecast-archive-from-activity-7378448846290575360-dRMZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAOgBWEBfMMmd2xB6DueOM-OrcPrj2eIBlM).

Give it a try! It'll be like that time in high school when you played too much Elder Scrolls Oblivion during a long weekend, and when you finally stepped outside into _nature_ you thought to yourself "woah, these graphics are incredible."

A massive thanks to Alden, Tony, Alex and Sam for getting this one out there!

# Icechunk support

We've also launched ~~Earthchunk~~ _Icechunk_ versions of the GFS and HRRR forecasts. It's internal only until we sort out a few final details, but if you'd feel the _need for speed_ and are prerelease-tolerant let us know and we can hook you up.

# weathering

In case you missed it we have a [podcast](https://dynamical.org/podcast) now! We so far have covered:

- The limits of predictability
- End-to-end data-driven weather prediction (Aardvark Weather)
- The Hybrid Approach (NeuralGCN)
- Efficient AI ensemble forecasts (ECMWF AIFS-CRPS, DeepMind FGN)

5 papers down, 188,727 to go! No new AI weather papers allowed.

# Scorecard

Hey, wouldn't you know it. Having stuff in this here catalog makes it easier to build things. I was tired of stats against reanalysis as "truth" so Alden and I hacked out a very simple [scorecard](https://dynamical.org/scorecard). When I say simple, I mean simple. For now it's just RMSE for 2m temp and precip. Of course, a few weeks after this went live, ISD-lite was killed in favor of GHCN so I gotta flip that over to keep things live-updating! URGH.
