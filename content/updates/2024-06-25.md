Introducing dynamical!Â 

Thank you for being the first to follow our journey making weather and climate data more accessible. We are humbled by the response. Our mission clearly strikes a chord - weather data today is a pain to work with.

Over **one hundred people** (!?) signed up to test the first versions of the data we endeavor to release. And thatâ€™s without having spilled the beans on the best parts ðŸ˜‰

So whatâ€™s the plan? First, check out Aldenâ€™s fantastic [introduction to dynamical.org](https://youtu.be/uR6-UVO_3k8?si=AgXz6DM6l0mYiENw) (video link). Second, [read](https://dynamical.org/about.html) about how we are designing dynamical to be a long-term steward and rock-solid foundation on which to build.

We are aiming to release our first public test next week in collaboration with [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop/): **a GFS analysis with a long historical record**. If you are interested in testing this out and havenâ€™t already told us, reply to this email. We plan to fast-follow with documentation and a data catalog with our roadmap.

Enjoy the [weather](https://ought.bandcamp.com/track/beautiful-blue-sky)!
