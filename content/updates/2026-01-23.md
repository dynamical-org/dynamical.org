What say the pantheon of forecasts? Shall AMS travel be a disaster?

> As the flakes that fall thick upon a winter's day, when Zeus is minded to snow and to display these his arrows to humankind - he lulls the wind to rest, and snows hour after hour till he has buried the tops of the high mountains, the headlands that jut into the sea, the grassy plains, and the tilled fields of men...

## Find Alden @ AMS

_"What Happens When Weather Data is Easy to Use?"_. Join Alden during the Environmental Data Access and Its Future: Open Data for Open Science Session on **Monday, January 26 at 2:15 PM CT** to explore how accessible weather data transforms research, operations, and decision-making across the atmospheric sciences community. Shoot him an <a href="mailto:alden@dynamical.org">email</a> if you want to meet up and chat!

## HRRR analysis

HRRR analysis (2018-09-16 to present) is now available in the [catalog](https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-hrrr-analysis/), including the Icechunk preview.

## Icechunk catalog parity party

Icechunk previews for our datasets are now listed on the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/?search=managedBy:dynamical.org)! Check out the Icechunk example usage in our docs for IFS ENS, GEFS, GFS, and HRRR forecasts to get started. With the addition of GEFS forecast and analysis **we now have an identical, live updating Icechunk Zarr for all live updating standard Zarr v3 datasets in our catalog!**

## Earthmover Marketplace

The "Union of Organizations Concerned That Earth Data Is Generally Too Hard To Work With" (still workshopping this title, but it has a good _ring_ to it) just became more powerful - Earthmover launched their [Marketplace](https://earthmover.io/marketplace). (Congrats team)

And the aforementioned dynamical.org Icechunk catalog is within!

## Steering committee minutes

Shrouded in mystery and intrigue, the steering committee guides the helm from the shadows. To lift the veil is to challenge authority itself, and... hm? What's that? The meeting notes are public?! Oh.

- [Q3 Steering Committee notes](https://dynamical.org/meetings/steering_committee_2025-09-03)
- [Q4 Steering Committee notes](https://dynamical.org/meetings/steering_committee_2025-12-03)

Shout out to all the contributors to cf_xarray which both a) now works great with our datasets and b) is part of our test suite to ensure all new datasets are CF compliant from the start. Thanks to our steering committee for guiding us towards more interoperable standards.
