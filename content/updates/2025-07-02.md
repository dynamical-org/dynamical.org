## GFS forecasts are live

GFS is GEFS' less ambiguous older sibling. The archive is processed and the updater is chugging: 4 years of 16 day forecasts, hourly step, released 4 times a day. GFS might be wrong, but at least it's confident!

A note from Alden, Chef de cuisine
> Tonight, I've prepared for you a dataset I think you will enjoy. Check out the example notebook linked in the [docs](https://dynamical.org/catalog/noaa-gfs-forecast/) to make your own interactive animation of an atmospheric river with buttery smooth hourly resolution. The way atmospheric rivers move reminds me of how [rivers move on land](https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/maps-of-the-lower-mississippi-harold-fisk/), only on a time scale of hours not years. Served as a semifreddo with a peach compote.

Did you catch episode number two of _weathering_? This time we talked about Aardvark Weather. As Marta put it: "Where does the end begin? Where does the end end? And what the HELL is happening in the middle?"
